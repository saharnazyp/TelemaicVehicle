## 🚗 Vehicle Telematics Analysis with Machine Learning

### 📌 Overview

This project aims to analyze vehicle telematics data to understand driving patterns, detect anomalies, and build predictive models that can help in improving vehicle efficiency, safety, and fleet diagnostics.

With the rise of IoT and connected vehicles, telematics systems generate huge volumes of data. This project takes a deep dive into such data to draw insights using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

### 🛠 Technologies & Tools

* Python 🐍
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
* Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)
* Google Drive (for large dataset hosting)

---

### 📥 Data Sources

The project uses raw telematics data including:

* GPS speed
* Battery level
* Engine temperature
* Fuel metrics (MAF, kpl, iat, etc.)
* Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC)
* Time-based sequences grouped by tripID

Data is loaded from `.csv` files and cleaned to remove duplicates, nulls, and inconsistent types.

---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key insights extracted using:

* Descriptive statistics
* Correlation heatmaps
* Distribution plots (speed, acceleration, engine load, etc.)
* Detection of duplicate rows and outliers

We also engineer useful features like:

* `acceleration` and `angle_change`
* Their squared values for non-linearity modeling

---

### 🧼 Preprocessing Highlights

* Categorical-to-numeric transformation
* Outlier handling
* Imputation of missing values
* Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
* Data reshaping for sequence-based modeling (`[samples, time_steps, features]`)

---

### 🤖 Machine Learning Modeling

Both traditional and deep learning models are tested:

#### ✅ Classical ML Models:

* Random Forest Classifier
* Logistic Regression

#### ✅ Deep Learning:

* LSTM (for temporal sequences across trips)
* Conv1D (for high-frequency pattern detection)

---

### 📈 Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Precision / Recall / F1-score
* Validation curves
* Confusion matrix (visualized)

We also use `class_weight='balanced'` to handle imbalanced classes like `faulty vs. normal` trips.

### 📦 Sample Prediction

The notebook supports end-to-end prediction on new sequences using the trained model, post-scaling and reshaping.

---

### 💡 Key Learnings

* Sensor data needs strong domain understanding to engineer effective features.
* Sequence models (like LSTM) are very well-suited for trip-based telematics data.
* Proper pipeline design ensures minimal duplication and easier deployment.

### 📈 Possible Extensions

* Integrate a live dashboard with Streamlit or Tableau for visual summaries
* Deploy as a REST API using FastAPI or Flask
* Add clustering to detect new behavior profiles
